	There are many transient inns and hostels that can suit your budget and other requirements,<br>
	and most of the tourist spots in the city are free! You can walk around the city or take the jeep.<br>
	Some places are hard to get to by tricycle or jeep, so you may have to take a taxi. Still, there are so<br>
	many other scenic spots for that perfect selfie or groufie. Affordable food is also available practically<br>
	everywhere. If you skip the shopping, even for just P3,000, you’ve already got yourself a perfectly <br>
	good but quick holiday.<br>
